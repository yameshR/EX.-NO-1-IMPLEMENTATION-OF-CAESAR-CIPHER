# EX. NO: 1(A) : IMPLEMENTATION OF CAESAR CIPHER

## AIM:
To implement the simple substitution technique named Caesar cipher using C language.

## ALOGORITHM

STEP-1: Read the plain text from the user.
STEP-2: Read the key value from the user.
STEP-3: If the key is positive then encrypt the text by adding the key with
each character in the plain text.
STEP-4: Else subtract the key from the plain text.
STEP-5: Display the cipher text obtained above.



## PROGRAM


## OUTPUT 

## RESULT 
 Thus the implementation of ceasar cipher had been executed successfully.
